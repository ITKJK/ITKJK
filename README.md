Welcome to my first github readme.

My name is Jami used to run my own IT-business in Finland where IT-business pays you nothing and gives you nothing, but headack. I am nerd, script kiddie,
coder, web designer, building bash, cmd, powershell and bunch of .NET coding projects and sure as hell like to drink beer smoke some and party like crazy
time-to-time.

Enough for introduction. 

Never used this system before and I will be releasing some well really shitty stuff which otherwise might seem extremely hard because
they are either badly coded by bigger corporations or otherwise needs to easy up.

I'll starter by adding a CMD or batch script I needed myself few years ago, something I had to build for myself few years ago in timeline of NT 6.0, because
microsoft Windows PE at NT6.0 to latest 10.1.22000.1 all has quite a few bugs while building the media while including components which needs to be in right
order while you add them to media which even Microsoft (any of their pages) informs wrong for everyone. So, it's really f'd up to test what components goes in
and in which order for every single ADK and PE you build.

(Anyone reading this has to excuse me as I use build numbers instead of OS names since it's easier for me to understand which systems all works.)


Kind Regards

ITKJK or genetix as known since 90's.
